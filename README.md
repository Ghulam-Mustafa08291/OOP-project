Project Title: Cloud Kingdom Tower Defense
Story:
A village is ruled by a cruel giant that demands a significant amount of the Village’s annual crop yield as a tribute, with such a constraint, the village developed methods of producing plants more and more efficiently with a combination of both science and magic. Tired of living in constant fear, the villagers come up with magical beans that can grow plants with special abilities. Fearing detection by the Giant, they agree to send one person to the Giant’s castle in the clouds called The Cloud Kingdom, to infiltrate the castle and defeat the Giant once and for all.

Project Description:
The game starts with the player climbing up the magic beanstalk to the Cloud Kingdom and entering into the magical castle where the Giant lived. The castle itself consists of multiple floors each floor having multiple rooms, each room being of one of the following types:

1-	Tutorial Room: The ground floor will consist of the tutorial room, teaching the player how to play.
2-	Battle Room: A battle room has a strange maze-like structure of hallways with guards, once the guards spot the player, they call for support, triggering the tower defense aspect of the game, beating each wave of enemies rewards the player with beans, which is the currency required to plant new magic plants. Beating the room rewards him with gold and has a rare chance to give the player a new plant.
3-	Reward Room: The reward room contains a chest that contains new plants, gear etc. For the player.
4-	Trap room: This is a reward room with a trap which can be disabled by the player if the spot it. If they manage to survive the trap or disable it, they can then access the reward.
5-	Shop Room: The shop room allows the player to purchase new plants and gear with the gold they received as a reward for clearing battle rooms.
6-	Mini-Boss room: Each floor has one mini-boss room except the final floor which has the main boss room. This room contains the stairs to get to the next floor, so to continue the progress towards the final boss's room the player must beat the mini boss.
7-	Main-Boss room: This is the final stage of the game found on the topmost floor of the castle. Defeating the Main Boss results in a game won screen.

Each floor will have a set number of rooms. The player will only know what type of room they are entering once they have entered it. The player will have the ability to back track into rooms they have already visited but the room events such as a battle or reward chest will only be triggered once. It’s not necessary to visit all rooms to move to the next stage. The goal on each floor will be to find the Mini-Boss room to progress to the next floor. Although exploration will be encouraged by the unique rewards from the reward rooms as well as a chance to buy good gear from shops.

The player has a limited amount of health, which when reduced to zero will result in a game over screen. The main objective is to make it to the final floor of the castle and defeat the final boss to win.
